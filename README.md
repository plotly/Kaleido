# Kaleido

Kaleido is a cross-platform library for generating static images for [Plotly][plotly]'s visualization library.
After installing it, you can use `fig.write_image("filename.png")` to save a plot to a file.

  </a>
</div>

## How It Works

The original version of kaleido included a custom build of the Chrome web browser,
which made it very large (hundreds of megabytes) and proved very difficult to maintain.
In contrast,
this version depends on [choreographer][choreographer],
a lightweight library that enables remote control of browsers from Python.
When you ask kaleido to create an image,
it uses choreographer to run a headless instance of Chrome to render and save your figure.
Please see choreographer's documentation for details.

> The new version of kaleido is a work on progress; we would be grateful for help testing it and improving it.
> If you find a bug, please report it in [our GitHub repository][repo],
> and please include a minimal reproducible example if you can.

## Installation

You can install kaleido from [PyPI][pypi] using pip:

```
$ pip install kaleido
```

## Use

Versions 4.9 and above of the Plotly Python library will automatically use kaleido for static image export when kaleido is installed.
For example:

```python
import plotly.express as px
fig = px.scatter(px.data.iris(), x="sepal_length", y="sepal_width", color="species")
fig.write_image("figure.png", engine="kaleido")
```

See the [Plotly static image export documentation][plotly-export] for more information.
