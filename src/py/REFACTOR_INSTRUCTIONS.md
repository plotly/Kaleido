We are just at the line of techdebt:

How to refactor:


1. We need more thoughtful design of how to manage parallel tasking with async/await
   a. We are beginning to look a bit like callback hell.
2. The above would probably accompany a switch from inheritance of choreo to composition
3. error_log and profile need to be full fledged classes.
